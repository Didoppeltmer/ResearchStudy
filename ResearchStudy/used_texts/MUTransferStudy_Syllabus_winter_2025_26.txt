Course Content Course descrip-tion The course offers the students to apply their knowledge in teams of 5-6 students in a real life business problem of the company “Würth” in Künzelsau. They serve as consultants to advise them on the given tasks of different departments. The speaker of the Management Board of Würth holds an internal competition on the topics of the students projects and is also present at the kickoff and final pitches. The students are mentored by the winners of the internal con-tests at Würth. They are also coached by the course instructor. This course offers a great op-portunity to gain insights in the company Würth, work on real life problems and to build a net-work for the future career.  The primary objective of the transfer study is to provide valuable recommendations and solu-tions for a real-life business case presented by an actual company. Throughout a span of ap-proximately 15 weeks (one semester), students engage in a comprehensive analysis of the given problem, conduct research, and critically evaluate relevant literature. They employ sci-entific methodologies, such as conducting questionnaires or interviews, to gather essential data and insights.

This plan allows them to address different aspects of the business case systematically and efficiently. As they progress, they aim to identify poten-tial challenges and opportunities, while also crafting innovative and feasible solutions that align with the company's goals. The study culminates with a comprehensive presentation of their findings, conclusions, and recommendations in front of representatives from the collaborating company. This final presentation is a crucial aspect of the study, as it serves as a platform for the students to demonstrate their in-depth understanding of the problem, showcase their research and presentation skills, and propose practical strategies that can benefit the company. The transfer study offers a valuable experiential learning opportunity for students, as it bridges the gap between academic knowledge and real-world applications. By working on a genuine business case, students gain practical insights and experience in dealing with real-world complexities and challenges. Moreover, the collaboration with a real company allows them to understand the dynamics of the business environment and how their academic ex-pertise can be utilized to create tangible impact. Overall, the transfer study serves as a win-win situation, benefiting both the students and the collaborating company. The students ac-quire hands-on experience and develop essential skills, while the company receives fresh perspectives and potential solutions to their real-world challenges, fostering a mutually bene-ficial relationship between academia and industry.

In order to do a fair grad-ing on your actual contributions and thoughts you put into the assignments, I expect from you to write a process report on the usage of AI tools for ANY assignment. Even if you did not use any AI tools (like deepl, ChatGPT,…), explain why you decided against it. The process documentation should include the aspects of Methodology, Applications, Examples, Reflection. See details below. Further expectations see also below. Methodology: • Describe the AI tools that were chosen for the assignment and provide a ra-tionale for their selection. • Explain the process followed to integrate and utilize the AI tools in the assign-ment. Application of AI Tools: • Provide specific information of how AI tools were applied in different stages of the assignment, such as data analysis, research, content generation, proof-read-ing or problem-solving. • Explain the reasoning behind the selection and application of each AI tool and how it contributed to the overall objectives of the assignment. • Showcase critical thinking by discussing the limitations, challenges, or potential biases associated with the use of AI tools and how they were addressed or miti-gated.  Examples and Outcomes: • Include exemplary screenshots or examples of the prompts used with AI tools and their corresponding outcomes or results. • Explain the significance of each example and how it influenced or shaped the overall content, insights, or conclusions of the assignment. • Reflect on the effectiveness and reliability of the AI tools used, highlighting any notable insights, discoveries, or challenges encountered. Reflection and Evaluation: • Reflect on your own contributions and critical thinking that went into the assign-ment, alongside the application of AI tools. • Discuss the evaluation of the strengths, limitations, and potential future improve-ments in utilizing AI tools for similar assignments or tasks. • Share personal insights or lessons learned from the experience of using AI tools and how it influenced your approach to the assignment. Formatting and Presentation: • Use clear and concise language, ensuring the report is well-structured and orga-nized. • Include appropriate headings, subheadings, and sections to enhance readability and understanding. • Provide a visually appealing layout with proper formatting, such as bullet points, numbered lists, and relevant illustrations or diagrams.

Length and Submission: • The process report should be approximately not exceed 1500 words in length, excluding any supporting screenshots or illustrations. • Submit the process report according to the deadline of the respective assign-ment.  Teamwork doc-umentation Document your teamwork. Take meeting minutes with tasks assigned to team mem-bers, attendance etc. In case a team member does not contribute anything to the team-work (“free rider problem”), the documentation can be handed over to the instructor, who can then decide on grade degradation.  ***Written with the help of ChatGPT
