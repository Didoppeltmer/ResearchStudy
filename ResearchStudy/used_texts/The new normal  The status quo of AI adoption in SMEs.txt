ABSTRACT
The recent surge in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has garnered sig-
nificant research attention. However, the existing literature 
reveals a fragmented landscape that hinders our understanding 
of how SMEs use AI. We address this through a systematic 
literature review wherein we analyze 106 peer-reviewed articles 
on AI adoption in SMEs and categorize states and trends into 
eight clusters: (1) compatibility, (2) infrastructure, (3) knowl -
edge, (4) resources, (5) culture, (6) competition, (7) regulation, 
and (8) ecosystem: according to the technology–organization– 
environment model. Our research provides valuable insights 
and identifies significant gaps in existing literature, notably 
overlooking trends identification as a pivotal driver and neglect -
ing legal requirements. Our study clarifies AI implementation 
within SMEs, offering a holistic and theoretically grounded per-
spective to empower researchers and practitioners to facilitate 
more effective adoption and application of AI within the SME 
sector.KEYWORDS

Introduction
Within the dynamic landscape of science and technology, artificial intelligence 
(AI) has emerged as a catalyst reshaping our interactions with technology, our 
problem-solving methods, and even our comprehension of intelligence itself 
(Giuggioli & Pellegrini, 2023 ). Despite the vast potential of AI, its integration 
within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) faces considerable hurdles, 
notably the challenges of change management (Nagy et al., 2023 ). Overcoming 
these challenges and fostering AI adoption is imperative for SMEs to thrive 
(Lemos et al., 2022 ).
Critically, boosting AI use within SMEs requires navigating the com -
plexities inherent in identifying suitable AI technologies and applying

ios (Hansen & Bøgh, 2021 ). The literature on applying AI in SMEs, while 
abundant, often lacks coherence and comprehensiveness (bin Ahmad 
et al., 2019 ; Giuggioli & Pellegrini, 2023 ; Treiblmaier, 2018 ). This is 
unfortunate, as AI adoption by SMEs has substantial potential benefits 
ranging from productivity enhancements to cost reductions to improved 
employee experiences (Chaudhuri et al., 2022 ).
Failure to embrace AI could have dire consequences for SMEs, 
including lost competitiveness and market share, diminished economic 
influence, and reduced employment opportunities (Baabdullah et al.,  
2021 ). While AI adoption strategies vary, they typically involve increas -
ing investments, automating processes, and upgrading systems and 
technologies to remain competitive (Hansen & Bøgh, 2021 ). It is essen -
tial to note, however, that overly complex AI applications may not be 
feasible for SMEs because of their cost and complexity (Moeuf et al.,  
2020 ).
Various theories exist to explain technology adoption within various 
contexts (Orr, 2003 ; Venkatesh et al., 2003 ). AI implementation within 
the SME context requires a theory that can comprehensively analyze its 
complexity and versatility (Khan et al., 2021 ). This study employs the 
technology—organization—environment (TOE) model (Tornatzky & 
Fleischer, 1990 ) to systematically analyze the current state of the literature. 
This framework offers valuable insights into the internal and external 
factors influencing technology adoption decisions within organizational 
contexts (Hossain & Quaddus, 2012 ).
The TOE model allows a structured examination of the dynamics influ -
encing AI adoption in SMEs by considering factors such as technological 
readiness, organizational capabilities, and environmental influences (El- 
Haddadeh, 2020 ). Against this backdrop, our study provides a structured 
overview of AI research within the SME sector, identifying challenges, 
facilitators, opportunities, and implementation domains. Employing 
a systematic literature review (SLR), we integrate existing research to offer 
valuable insights for researchers and practitioners. Through this consolida -
tion, we aim to advance AI adoption in SMEs and contribute to the existing 
body of knowledge in this field.
The study is structured as follows. The theoretical background for defin -
ing AI within the context of implementation within SMEs using the TOE 
model is presented; our research methods are described; followed by the 
results; and a comparative analysis of our findings with previous research, 
offering academic and practical recommendations. We identify the limita -
tions of the research and avenues for future research, which also presents 
the conclusions.1298
 J. SCHWAEKE ET AL.Theoretical foundation of artificial intelligence and its implementation 
requirements in small and medium-sized enterprises
Definition of artificial intelligence
AI has rapidly transformed the world and impacted all areas of business 
functionality (Budhwar et al., 2023 ). It encompasses three generations: 
(1) artificial narrow intelligence, designed for specific tasks, (2) artificial 
general intelligence, capable of independently solving a wide range of 
problems, and (3) artificial superintelligence, anticipated to possess 
scientific creativity along with social and technical skills (Deepa et al.,  
2024 ). AI, often referred to as machine-generated intelligence, empowers 
machines to perform tasks and tackle complex challenges that have 
traditionally exceeded human cognitive capabilities (Giuggioli & 
Pellegrini, 2023 ). The technical maturity and market readiness of AI- 
related methods and processes are continually improving, reflecting the 
high-level engineering and research activity within this domain. 
Machine learning and deep learning, often synonymous with AI, 
describe how computers can learn patterns based on input data. AI 
also comprises various vital subdomains, such as voice recognition, 
image identification, natural language processing, expert systems, neural 
networks, planning, robotics, and intelligent agents (Whitson, 2024 ). AI 
is characterized by its multidisciplinary nature (Hermann, 2023 ) and 
integration with cutting-edge technologies (Hansen & Bøgh, 2021 ). 
Moreover, AI plays a crucial role in the Internet of Things (IoT), 
which constitutes an interconnected network of physical devices capable 
of communication and remote monitoring (Ashton, 2009 ). AI encom -
passes various methods, including machine learning, an analytical 
approach applicable to data from IoT devices (Hansen & Bøgh, 2021 ). 
AI processes vast volumes of IoT data to generate actionable insights, 
bridging the software languages enforced by IoT devices (bin Ahmad 
et al., 2019 ). In addition, AI enhances augmented reality (AR), 
a human–computer interaction system that merges real and virtual 3D 
objects in real time (Azuma et al., 2001 ). AI plays a critical role in the 
advancement of manufacturing assembly robots, enabling them to work 
more efficiently, safely, and intelligently and improving processing accu -
racy and effectiveness (Soori et al., 2023 ). Last, AI intersects with 
blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that securely and transpar -
ently records digital assets (Treiblmaier, 2018 ). This study focuses on 
AI-related technologies from a business perspective, as AI has shifted 
from a futuristic concept understood by a select group of experts to 
become an affordable mainstream solution transcending its application 
solely to large enterprises (Giuggioli & Pellegrini, 2023 ).JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
 1299Factors influencing the adoption of artificial intelligence in small and 
medium-sized enterprises
The definition of SMEs varies by country (Ardic et al., 2011 ). SMEs are defined 
by the EU Commission as organizations with fewer than 250 employees and 
revenues below EUR 50 million per year (European Commission, n.d.). 
Meanwhile, in the United States, the Small Business Administration cate-
gorizes small businesses based on ownership structure, employee count, earn -
ings, and industry (United States Small Business Administration, n.d.). For 
example, in production, an SME generally consists of 500 or fewer employees. 
The Internal Revenue Service defines small businesses as entities with assets of 
$10 million or less, while those surpassing this threshold are considered large 
businesses (Internal Revenue Service, 2023 ). Compared with larger corpora -
tions, SMEs often face limitations due to constrained human and financial 
resources (Dörr et al., 2023 ). However, new technologies are anticipated to 
profoundly affect SMEs and society at large, which could ameliorate some 
constraints encountered by SMEs (Ameen et al., 2022 ). In recent years, the 
emergence of AI-related technologies such as blockchain, IoT, and social 
media have affected organizational processes and are poised to replace tradi -
tional methods in SMEs (Giuggioli & Pellegrini, 2023 ). While studies show 
that implementing AI technologies offers new market opportunities and 
process development potential for SMEs (Chatterjee et al., 2022 ), a recent 
Deloitte report indicates a discrepancy—94% of business leaders believe that 
AI will be crucial for success in the next five years, but that its implementation 
will lead to delayed outcomes. Consequently, willingness to invest in AI 
decreased from 85% in 2021 to 76% in the surveyed group (Mittal et al., 2022 ).
Several determinants influence SMEs’ adoption of AI technologies. 
Compatibility, readiness, efficiency improvement, and time savings are key 
factors that directly and indirectly affect AI adoption through accounting 
automation (Devkota et al., 2022 ; Lee & Tajudeen, 2020 ). Chatterjee et al. 
(2022 ) emphasize the significance of perceived usefulness, ease of use, will-
ingness to change, and strategic planning for successful applications of AI 
technology. Dörr et al. (2023 ) identify various determinants for successful 
digital transformation, encompassing executive management, strategy, 
employees, culture, data management, and more. Korherr et al. (2022 ) outline 
critical factors for transitioning to analytics-based decision-making involving 
management behavior, infrastructure, organization, and culture. Importantly, 
AI offers many opportunities to SMEs. Empirical studies reveal that the 
application of intelligent communication systems leads to a higher degree of 
customer experience and satisfaction, thereby providing a higher degree of 
loyalty and opening new market opportunities due to a higher level of custo -
mer data (Rizomyliotis et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, AI enhances SME decision- 
making for complex analyses where SMEs deal with large data and provide 1300
 J. SCHWAEKE ET AL.customers with bespoke services and products. In addition, SMEs can achieve 
enhanced efficiency through automated processes (Hunter, 2019 ). An increase 
in organizational innovativeness and capabilities leads to a corresponding 
increase in the adoption of AI technologies by SMEs. These findings under -
score the importance of fostering an environment conducive to SME innova -
tion coupled with the development of relevant capabilities. This suggests that 
SMEs that cultivate a culture of innovation and possess the necessary capabil -
ities are more likely to embrace and effectively use AI technologies (El- 
Haddadeh, 2020 ). Despite the market opportunities offered by digital tech-
nologies, SMEs encounter challenges when adopting them (Ameen et al.,  
2022 ). SMEs are typically unable to compete with dynamic market challenges. 
The limited availability of technologies and resources constrains SMEs from 
flourishing and becoming leaders and drivers of economic growth in light of 
complex circumstances within the global environment (Chatterjee et al.,  
2022 ). Nonetheless, SMEs play a pivotal role in the international economy. 
Recognizing this, the EU aims to enhance SMEs’ business activities and ensure 
their alignment with updated technologies because their international compe -
titiveness influences economic stability (Hansen & Bøgh, 2021 ).
Technology–organization–environment model
The TOE framework was essentially coined by Tornatzky et al. (1983 ) to 
exhaustively explicate behavioral intentions and the implementation of inno -
vation at the firm level (Nguyen et al., 2022 ). The literature on SME adoption 
of AI technologies encompasses various clusters, each delineating AI adap -
tiveness within an organizational context. To provide a structured analysis and 
delineate avenues for further research, we employ the TOE framework, a well- 
established theoretical model present in recent academic literature (El- 
Haddadeh, 2020 ; Nguyen et al., 2022 ; Tornatzky et al., 1983 ). Using 
a theoretical foundation to study the adoption of digital innovations in 
organizations necessitates careful attention to the factors that influence the 
adoption process. In this context, existing literature has confirmed that the 
TOE framework is suitable for analyzing the specific innovation dynamics 
affecting organizational adoption, particularly in the case of technical innova -
tion dynamics (El-Haddadeh, 2020 ). Understanding the various factors influ -
encing organizational adoption of AI can link the adoption of new 
technologies to a company’s technological, organizational, and environmental 
characteristics. This linkage provides scholars and decision-makers with 
a broader perspective on the factors affecting AI adoption within the SME 
context (Khan et al., 2021 ). While frameworks like the technology acceptance 
model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology focus on 
individual acceptance decisions, the complexity and scale of organizational 
technologies often necessitate a more robust framework. The TOE framework JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
 1301delineates factors influenced by an organization’s introduction of information 
technology from three contextual perspectives: environmental, technological, 
and organizational (Tornatzky & Fleischer, 1990 ).
The environmental context encompasses the external conditions in which 
companies operate, such as industry dynamics, competitors, and governmen -
tal influence. The technological context comprises internal and external tech-
nologies faced by the organization, encompassing market-available 
technologies and those existing within the organization. Last, the organiza -
tional context delineates the attributes and resources of the firm, including 
size, hierarchy, and human resources (Tornatzky et al., 1983 ).
Various studies have applied the TOE model in various ways ranging from 
cost-setting, security concerns, and management support as independent 
variables to integrating organizational factors with theories of innovation 
diffusion and technology acceptance. These studies have contributed to our 
understanding of the factors influencing AI adoption in SMEs (Lee & Lee,  
2014 ). Each study highlights how the three elements—technology, organiza -
tion, and environment—affect how a firm identifies the need for, searches for, 
and adopts new technology. SMEs must carefully navigate the adoption of 
innovative and disruptive technologies due to the significant impact such 
changes can have on technological, organizational, and environmental 
dynamics (Khan et al., 2021 ).
However, empirical studies testing the TOE framework have used 
slightly different factors within the technological, organizational, and 
environmental contexts. Researchers agree with Tornatzky and 
Fleischer (1990 ) that these three contexts influence adoption, but they 
have identified unique sets of factors or measures for each specific 
technology or context being studied. For example, Zhu et al. (2004 ) 
argue that “technology readiness” is a crucial factor in the technological 
context affecting the adoption of e-business. Similarly, “firm size,” 
“global scope,” and “financial resources” are key factors in understand -
ing how the organizational context influences e-business adoption 
(Baker, 2011 ). Other scholars suggest that complexity and observability 
were not significant factors for Chinese SMEs in adopting digital inno -
vations, whereas they were highly significant for Pakistani SMEs in 
adopting mobile payment systems (Khan et al., 2021 ). Notably, recent 
research by Nguyen et al. (2022 ) highlights top management support, 
entrepreneurial orientation, and technological orientation as significant 
factors positively influencing AI adoption. These results are also sup-
ported by scholars focusing on determinants of AI adoption within the 
enterprise environment (Dörr et al., 2023 ; Korherr et al., 2022 ), ulti-
mately leading to improved processes and better performance, as shown 
in Figure 1 (Nguyen et al., 2022 ). Scholars have explored the critical 
factors for adopting IoT, AI, and cloud computing within organizations 1302
 J. SCHWAEKE ET AL.using the TOE model. They have discovered that technological factors, 
such as compatibility and uncertainty, are the primary influences for 
applying AI technologies, while organizational factors like company size 
appear to be less significant (Jang et al., 2022 ).
By structuring different clusters and integrating them into a theoretical 
foundation, the TOE model facilitates a comprehensive analysis of 
whether technologies are adaptable within an organization. Therefore, 
we contend that examining the influential factors within the three clus-
ters—technology, organization, and environment—will provide scholars 
and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of the current 
state of research on AI application in SMEs. This highlights the usefulness 
of the TOE model in comprehending and analyzing AI technology adop -
tion by SMEs.
Methodology
The chosen research methodology, SLR, is known for its transparency, replic -
ability, and structured overviewing of existing research (Tranfield et al., 2003 ). 
This approach is used to explore AI technology applications within SMEs. The 
SLR approach offers several benefits, including (1) reproducible steps for 
review validity and (2) comprehensive synthesis and analysis of accumulated 
knowledge (Kraus et al., 2023 ). Employing SLR to systematically map AI- 
related studies in SMEs provides a holistic understanding of AI technology 
applications within this domain in the literature (Kraus et al., 2022 ; Sauer & 
Seuring, 2023 ). Furthermore, scholars within the managerial field (a focus of 
this study) have proven that SLR is quite important (Kraus et al., 2023 , 2024 ; 
Öztürk et al., 2024 ).

 1303Search strategy
We employed EBSCO and Web of Science as the journal databases for our 
study because of the extensive body of literature they cover. Appendix A 
provides a table of their subdatabases, including their contributions to this 
study. Our focus was on the subject areas “artificial intelligence” and “SME.” 
We conducted our searches using Boolean search terms in the title, abstract, 
and keywords sections. Specifically, we used the term “artificial intelligence” in 
conjunction with various other terms like “SMEs or small and medium-sized 
enterprises,” “SME,” and “small business.” We employed diverse spellings and 
synonyms to encompass a broad range of possibilities, such as “artificial 
intelligence,” “ai,” “deep learning,” and “machine learning.” These feasible 
options resulted in the 36 search strings found in Appendix B, all of which 
were utilized. The period reviewed was before and including August 2023. We 
focused on peer-reviewed journal articles to ensure methodological rigor 
(Jones et al., 2011 ). In Figure 2, one can find the number of publications 
per year for the papers in the study.
Initially, our search yielded 12,548 articles. Details of the SLR process 
and the number of papers retained after each stage can be found in 
Figure 3. The material collection comprises only peer-to-peer-reviewed 
articles to obtain a comparable body of research. We included all peer- 
reviewed journals that were output by the research strings in German and 
English. The observed time frame is 2003 until June 2024, as AI began 
gaining importance for SMEs in the early 2000s. The search identified 768 
articles in the EBSCO database for further analysis after eliminating

remaining papers by reading their abstracts. Further exclusion criteria 
retained only articles linked to Artificial Intelligence and SMEs within 
a business context. Studies outside the business scope were discounted 
after reading the titles and abstracts. Considered out of scope was any 
research regarding the mathematical nature of AI and its IT components, 
as technical descriptions of the technologies do not answer the research 
questions. Non-peer-reviewed publications were also discounted. Further 
excluded were articles that did not explicitly analyze the application of AI 
technologies within SMEs, but rather within larger companies. Our study 
includes all industries identified in the contributions identified. This 
review process led us to identify 305 papers specifically centered on AI 
in SMEs. After reading the full texts of the remaining articles and apply -
ing the filter criteria, the final sample comprised 106 articles from the 
EBSCO and Web of Science databases.

Results
The 106 articles in our SLR are categorized into eight distinct clusters, each 
representing a different aspect of the impact of AI on SMEs, as depicted in 
Table 1. The largest cluster, “Compatibility,” with 19 contributions, discusses 
the importance of aligning old and new IT systems, strategies, and company 
values. The “Culture” cluster (19) explores attitudes toward innovation and 
technology adoption. The third-largest cluster, “Resources” (17), focuses on 
financial and personnel resources, leadership styles to mitigate scarce 
resources, and strategic utilization. The “Infrastructure” cluster, with 16 con-
tributions, discusses SMEs’ need to adopt AI, relying on existing IT infra -
structure and a business-focused approach. The “Knowledge” cluster, with 10 
contributions, emphasizes the significance of employees’ expertise and knowl -
edge, highlighting their role in successful technology transformation, knowl -
edge exchange with global experts, digital proficiency, and their correlation 
with positive attitudes toward AI technologies. In the “Ecosystem” cluster (9), 
SMEs strategically collaborate with external organizations for research and 
development (R&D), leveraging diverse knowledge sources and external sup-
port to effectively integrate AI into their operations. In the “Competition” 
cluster (8), competitive pressures drive organizations to adopt AI technologies 
to enhance performance and gain a competitive advantage. The “Regulation” 
cluster (8) discusses AI regulation in SMEs, emphasizing the importance of 
strategic policies and government involvement with investments in training 
curricula crucial to equipping the workforce with digital skills. A list of the 
individual contributions analyzed in this study can be found in Appendix C.
Application of the technology–organization–environment model to our 
systematic literature review
Technology
The first enabler cluster within the TOE model consists of aspects of technol -
ogy. Here we evaluate the compatibility of new and existing technology within 
the company’s IT landscape (Nguyen et al., 2022 ).
Compatibility
Research indicates that the primary drivers for AI implementation originate 
from within the company. A key factor in successful adoption is compatibility, 
which involves aligning AI with the company’s strategy and current IT land -
scape (Almeida & Wasim, 2023 ). Hansen and Bøgh (2021 ) highlight that 1306

 1307alignment with existing IT processes and the current IT strategy is crucial for 
AI adoption. In addition, integrating AI into the existing IT landscape pro-
vides competitive advantages like improved productivity and scalability 
(Hunter, 2019 ).
Ensuring smooth integration of new technologies is essential, especially for 
manufacturing SMEs, which often use machinery and production methods 
over extended periods. These companies need to avoid compatibility issues 
that could lead to additional adjustments, effort, and financial investment 
(Hansen & Bøgh, 2021 ). Therefore, when SMEs invest in new technologies, 
they prioritize ensuring these technologies work seamlessly with their existing 
systems. As AI integration advances, other factors gain significance. Some 
emphasize the strategic importance of technology road mapping for efficient 
AI application, noting that unplanned technology frameworks can impede AI 
adoption and advocating for a value-centric approach (Kim & Seo, 2023 ). 
Compatibility also encompasses work practices, needs, and company culture, 
which can influence AI adoption (Chatterjee et al., 2022 ). Perceived ease of use 
is critical for technology acceptance, and perceived usefulness, defined as the 
belief that using a system will enhance job performance, plays a significant 
role. When SME leaders believe AI can enhance performance, they are more 
likely to adopt it (Fatima & Bilal, 2019 ). Numerous studies have consistently 
shown that perceived usefulness positively influences the intention to use and 
implement AI (Escobar et al., 2023 ; Chatterjee et al., 2022 ).
Infrastructure within small and medium-sized enterprises
AI readiness in SMEs is intricately linked to their IT and technological 
infrastructures (Polas et al., 2022 ). AI technologies are highly integrated and 
interconnected, functioning systematically rather than in isolation. When 
implementing AI, SMEs must adopt a technical as well as a business-focused 
approach. Even though AI readiness focuses strongly on IT aspects, SMEs can 
survive, grow, and remain competitive by recognizing the strategic value of 
digital applications (Denicolai et al., 2021 ).
The importance of AI readiness might have financial implications for SMEs 
when not preparing the digital change. If AI readiness in terms of IT infra -
structure is low, SMEs may perceive investments in AI as excessive and the 
technology as too difficult to manage (Chowdhury et al., 2023 ). Therefore, the 
ability of SMEs to adapt quickly to changes significantly influences their 
capacity to innovate and adopt new technologies like AI.
A holistic perspective ensures that AI integration aligns with organizational 
objectives, promoting seamless incorporation into existing processes (Polas 
et al., 2022 ).
Denning (2020 ) notes that in today’s dynamic business landscape, the 
successful integration of AI hinges on delivering seamless and efficient IT 
processes.1308
 J. SCHWAEKE ET AL.Organization
The second enabler cluster focuses on organizational aspects within compa -
nies, such as knowledge, resources, and culture (Nguyen et al., 2022 ).
Knowledge
The human aspect, a key AI enabler in SMEs, involves employees’ expertise 
and knowledge. Choudrie et al. (2023 ) emphasize the role of expertise in 
successful technology transformation and its impact on innovation diffusion. 
Knowledge exchange connects global experts (Łabędzka, 2021 ), highlighting 
employees’ digital proficiency to apply new technologies. Expertise and knowl -
edge lead to relative advantages and predict a positive attitude toward AI 
technologies (von Garrel & Jahn, 2022 ). If employees believe AI enhances their 
performance, they embrace it and perceive value in user-friendly AI. 
Willingness to change is vital because of new technology’s uncertainties 
(Łabędzka, 2021 ). On top of that, efficient utilization of AI technologies equips 
human resources with essential information and skills, such as computer 
literacy, critical thinking, and effective decision-making (Grashof and Kopka 
(2023 ). By embracing advanced technologies and integrating AI strategically 
with human resources, SMEs can leverage the transformative potential of AI to 
gain a competitive advantage, foster innovation, and achieve sustainable 
growth (Choudrie et al., 2023 ). A human-centric approach is highlighted by 
Bagale et al. (2023 ), who demonstrate that perceived AI usefulness positively 
impacts digital transformation, demanding effectiveness, performance, trust, 
and risk management.
Resources
AI adoption faces challenges including finances, resistance, compatibility, 
complexity, and legal issues. SMEs may face challenges related to limited 
funds (Dörr et al., 2023 ). Not surprisingly, AI adoption in SMEs is often 
influenced by financial and personnel resources, which can either support or 
hinder its implementation (Kraus et al., 2017 ). SMEs may face hindrances due 
to poor technical expertise, inadequate skills, or improper management styles 
due to limited AI education (Liu, 2023 ). Furthermore, the lack of AI specialists 
limits the potential for AI in SMEs (Lemos et al., 2022 ). Challenges also arise 
from the feasibility of overhauling systems and processes, limited access to 
resources for implementing technology, high risks associated with technology 
adoption, and concerns about its effectiveness (Baabdullah et al., 2021 ). 
Limited funds impact SMEs’ AI investment (Venkateswarlu et al., 2022 ), 
hampering cost-effectiveness (Khan et al., 2023 ). In addition, with limited 
financial resources, SMEs often acknowledge the benefits of AI systems but 
fear the associated costs (Dörr et al., 2023 ). Smaller enterprises, however, 
benefit from streamlined communication and fewer management levels, JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
 1309allowing direct management involvement in R&D (Sousa & Wilks, 2018 ). This 
direct involvement minimizes the risk of miscommunication between techni -
cal personnel and senior management, fostering agile decision-making pro-
cesses. Capacity issues arise from limited funds, impacting research and 
networks. However, despite perceiving resource constraints as a barrier, 
SMEs possess a greater awareness of environmental needs, leading to 
a higher intention to innovate (Rojas-Córdova et al., 2020 ). The agile and 
adaptable nature of SMEs, coupled with their direct leadership involvement, 
presents advantages in implementing AI. Although resource limitations may 
exist, SMEs’ responsiveness to environmental demands drives their determi -
nation to innovate and embrace transformative technologies.
Culture
Within SMEs, the integration of AI presents several challenges, with organiza -
tional culture emerging as a pivotal factor. Delving into the organizational 
culture cluster, one might explore how SMEs that have embraced AI undergo 
a profound transformation in their cultural fabric (bin Ahmad et al., 2019 ). 
This reshaping of processes and business paradigms brought about by AI 
profoundly influences a firm’s culture.
Research indicates that this cultural facet can be dissected into three distinct 
components. First, fostering a learning culture involves honing the work -
force’s AI-related skills and capabilities through shared learning spaces, 
enabling mutual knowledge exchange and constructive feedback. This learn -
ing readiness within the workforce enhances the organization’s agility in 
assimilating new technologies, thereby bolstering sustainable growth. 
Simultaneously, the exigency for ongoing skill acquisition on individual and 
organizational levels becomes apparent. This readiness hinges on adept IT 
resources and well-prepared employees poised to seamlessly adopt innovative 
technologies (Khan et al., 2022 ). Comprehensive education and practical 
training empower SME workers, allaying apprehensions and facilitating per-
ceived ease of use (Hamdan et al., 2022 ).
Communication constitutes the second facet of organizational culture per-
tinent to AI implementation. Open dialogue with stakeholders and employees 
is vital for acclimatizing them to the constant flux accompanying AI integra -
tion (Khan et al., 2022 ). A learning organization ethos, marked by 
a willingness to embrace change and learn from errors, is fundamental for 
AI adoption in SMEs (Kucharska & Bedford, 2020 ). The embrace of mistakes 
is intrinsic to this culture, catalyzing growth underscored by adept managerial 
support.
This brings us to the third dimension of organizational culture—leadership 
style and management commitment in the context of AI. Top-tier manage -
ment’s unwavering support proves to be important in the successful assimila -
tion of new technologies. The fluidity of leadership styles is imperative, 1310
 J. SCHWAEKE ET AL.mirroring AI’s propensity to reshape business models, necessitating the ability 
to unfreeze, freeze, and refreeze resources in alignment with congenial strate -
gies (Khan et al., 2022 ). Leadership plays a strong role in the dynamic 
capabilities of firms through the ongoing development of new practices 
(Quansah & Hartz, 2022 ). Quansah et al. (2021 ) observed that adaptive SME 
leaders engage key stakeholders in knowledge development and deployment to 
survive uncertainty. Notably, leadership roles demand adaptability and pro-
blem-solving prowess and by investing in workforce development, firms gain 
a competitive edge. The intricate interplay between AI integration and orga -
nizational culture within SMEs is a multifaceted endeavor. A proactive learn -
ing culture, continuous skills development, transparent communication, and 
adaptable leadership collectively shape a fertile ground for SMEs to seamlessly 
integrate AI and forge a path toward sustainable progress.
Environment
The third enabler cluster focuses on external factors, such as competitors, 
governmental regulations, and ecosystems (Nguyen et al., 2022 ).
Competition
External competitive pressures can influence the adoption of AI in an organi -
zation. If competing organizations perform more effectively, other organiza -
tions are pressured to compete as well. With increasing competitive pressure, 
organizations can use emerging technologies to gain a competitive advantage 
(Chaudhuri et al., 2022 ). The increasing opportunity to obtain a higher service 
orientation with AI, as well as to develop new business models and open up 
new markets, are further relevant factors (Merkel-Kiss & von Garrel, 2022 ). 
Experts and expert communities played a key role across different stages of the 
SMEs’ innovation process (Albats et al., 2020 ).
Regulation
The regulation of AI in SMEs necessitates strategic policies and government 
involvement to ensure their successful integration. As AI’s significance con-
tinues to grow, investing in training curricula becomes paramount to equip 
the workforce with essential digital skills for the future (World Economic 
Forum, 2020 ). Given the crucial role of SMEs on national and global levels, 
understanding their performance and efficiency is vital for effective policy -
making (Boubaker et al., 2023 ). However, SMEs face a challenge in embracing 
digital transformation without a positive return on investment (ROI) (Hwang 
& Kim, 2022 ). Effective policies and government support must address these 
challenges, offering incentives, and guidance to facilitate AI adoption in SMEs, 
ensuring their competitiveness and sustainable growth in the global economy 
(Dey et al., 2023 ).JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
 1311Ecosystem
SMEs strategically employ various approaches to harness the potential of AI in 
their operations. One key approach is collaborating within their ecosystem. 
Due to limited innovative resources and capabilities, SMEs often partner with 
external organizations for collaborative R&D (Qu et al., 2021 ). This collabora -
tion is vital for several reasons. For instance, it allows SMEs to bypass the 
significant internal investment of time and resources required to develop 
technological capabilities, thereby focusing on new product development 
(Tsai & Wang, 2008 ). In addition, collaborations between SMEs and industrial 
partners using machine learning-based decisions result in high satisfaction 
rates when R&D expenditure and research intensity are high (Jun et al., 2021 ).
Haddoud et al. (2023 ) demonstrate that collaborative practices in AI appli -
cations help SMEs overcome institutional voids, facilitating the successful 
development of innovative products and enhancing their access to export 
markets. This collaborative innovation provides access to diverse knowledge, 
aiding AI implementation and technology integration. Moreover, SMEs lever -
age external support to foster innovation, with networks serving as key sources 
of innovation (Hermawati & Gunawan, 2021 ).
Collaborative AI activities with external partners and universities enable 
SMEs to explore operational opportunities and achieve international growth 
(Haddoud et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, better access to customers can leverage 
the potential of AI. By using AI technologies, SMEs can work closely with 
customers and obtain first-hand feedback (Hermawati & Gunawan, 2021 ). AI 
tools can quickly gather customer feedback cost-efficiently, though they have 
weaknesses such as lower accuracy, distortion, low user seriousness, and less 
structured data (Mount & Martinez, 2014 ).
By strategically employing these approaches, SMEs effectively integrate AI 
into their operations, driving innovation and securing competitive advantages 
in today’s dynamic business landscape.
Improved processes and better performance
Research has demonstrated that the application of AI offers numerous benefits 
for SMEs when well-integrated into the existing IT landscape. Scholars have 
investigated various use cases and business functions where AI can be effec -
tively applied, such as risk management, human resources, and marketing. For 
instance, AI can predict credit risks, thereby lowering costs and enhancing 
decision-making processes (Jutasompakorn et al., 2023 ).
In marketing, AI provides innovative AR experiences that significantly 
improve customer satisfaction (Sousa & Wilks, 2018 ). It also allows firms to 
gather first-hand customer feedback cost-efficiently, despite potential weak -
nesses in accuracy and structure (Mount & Martinez, 2014 ). In addition, AI 
enhances customer experiences and loyalty by supporting supply chain and 1312
 J. SCHWAEKE ET AL.sustainable practices (Liu, 2023 ). AI tools improve decision-making and 
insights, contributing to better customer satisfaction (Babucea & Rabontu,  
2022 ; Rizomyliotis et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, AI in e-commerce boosts market 
share, efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction by providing faster 
product information and behavior analysis (Fonseka et al., 2022b ).
In the realm of human resources, AI supports administrative tasks and 
personnel searches, addressing challenges related to employment and educa -
tion (Weber, 2023 ). The involvement of top managers in AI initiatives facil-
itates the implementation of action plans, including human resources training 
and communication of AI benefits (Baabdullah et al., 2021 ).
AI analysis tools play a crucial role in enhancing resource efficiency, redu -
cing costs, and providing extra value for companies (Chaudhuri et al., 2022 ). 
In particular, AI enhances efficiency in automating processes, creating inno -
vative insights, engaging with stakeholders, and providing an improved cus-
tomer experience (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Despite these benefits, challenges 
persist, such as identifying suitable processes and achieving team acceptance 
(Andrade, 2020 ; Beerbaum, 2021 ; Carraro, 2021 ; Hindel et al., 2020 ; Hofmann 
et al., 2020 ; Ribeiro et al., 2021 ; Turcu & Turcu, 2021 ). In addition, AI can only 
be adopted efficiently throughout the organization with the commitment of 
senior management, making that commitment crucial in enabling technolo -
gical ecosystems through AI adaptation initiatives (Lemos et al., 2022 ).
Discussion
We crossed our eight thematic clusters with the three dimensions of the TOE 
model to highlight the most relevant emerging areas, as shown in Figure 4. The 
discussion surrounding the advantages and disadvantages inherent in AI 
integration underscores the multifaceted nature of this process. While AI 
promises significant benefits in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and customer 
satisfaction across various domains, it also poses challenges such as financial 
constraints, resistance, compatibility issues, and legal and technical complex -
ities. Implementing and using AI unequivocally leads to an increase in enter -
prise innovation (Barczak et al., 2019 ). AI technologies, distinguished by their 
integrated and connected characteristics, operate systematically rather than in 
isolation, shaping their seamless incorporation within the SME ecosystem 
(Hwang & Kim, 2022 ). For SMEs, implementing transformative technologies 
like AI necessitates a business-focused approach surpassing mere IT consid -
erations (Denicolai et al., 2021 ). This holistic perspective ensures alignment 
with organizational objectives and that AI’s integration augments existing 
processes. Our findings indicate that implementing AI leads to process 
improvements due to improved customer communication and efficient hand -
ling of data, which aligns with the TOE model. AI enables SMEs to reach wider 
customer bases, optimize profits, and save resources (Chaudhuri et al., 2022 ; JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
 1313Christen et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the pivotal role of a positive ROI emerges as 
a decisive factor in determining the feasibility of AI adoption, emphasizing the 
need for a thorough understanding of its potential benefits and costs. Our 
examination reveals that the adoption of AI in SMEs is characterized by 
facilitators and impediments, shaping the trajectory of its integration. 
However, the mapping of these clusters with the TOE model underscores 
Figure 4. Clustered findings in the TOE model (elaboration by the authors).1314
 J. SCHWAEKE ET AL.nuanced gaps, particularly in the environmental aspect. Governmental policies 
play a pivotal role in influencing SMEs’ digital transformation efforts, neces -
sitating supportive frameworks to overcome financial constraints associated 
with AI implementation (Siahaan & Tan, 2022 ). Furthermore, external com -
petitive pressures drive AI adoption as organizations seek to gain 
a competitive edge through enhanced customer anticipation and data manage -
ment capabilities (Chaudhuri et al., 2022 ). Despite acknowledging the impor -
tance of resource allocation and positive ROI, challenges such as financial 
constraints, resistance, compatibility issues, and legal complexities persist in 
the adoption journey (Hwang & Kim, 2022 ; Kraus et al., 2017 ; Merkel-Kiss & 
von Garrel, 2022 ). Moreover, the issue of legal uncertainties surrounding AI 
adoption in SMEs underscores the need for comprehensive frameworks to 
provide guidance for navigating regulatory landscapes (Merkel-Kiss & von 
Garrel, 2022 ).
Similarly, the observability dimension underscores the necessity of visible 
perceived value to drive AI adoption, emphasizing effectiveness, performance, 
trustworthiness, and risk mitigation (Chatterjee et al., 2022 ; Nguyen et al.,  
2022 ).
While limited resources are seen as one of the most hindering factors, 
management commitment can compensate for that negative, as it strengthens 
communication between experts, driving an innovative and progressive mind -
set within the company (Rojas-Córdova et al., 2020 ). Hence, senior manage -
ment commitment emerges as a critical determinant in fostering AI 
integration initiatives, facilitating action plan implementation, and overcom -
ing organizational challenges (Lemos et al., 2022 ). In addition, firm size 
influences AI adoption dynamics, with smaller enterprises leveraging stream -
lined communication channels and heightened innovation intentions (Qu 
et al., 2021 ; Rojas-Córdova et al., 2020 ).
Entrepreneurial orientation further shapes SMEs’ approach to technological 
adoption, with a balance between risk-taking and effective risk-management 
practices driving innovation efforts (Kemendi et al., 2022 , Schwertner, 2017 ; 
Miller, 1983 ). The holistic integration of AI technologies within SME ecosys -
tems underscores its transformative potential, driving process improvements, 
enhanced customer experiences, and sustainable practices (Christen et al.,  
2022 ; Denicolai et al., 2021 ; Hwang & Kim, 2022 ; Liu, 2023 ; Merkel-Kiss & 
von Garrel, 2022 ; Rizomyliotis et al., 2022 ).
In summary, our findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of AI 
adoption in SMEs, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches and 
targeted interventions to maximize its potential benefits while mitigating the 
associated challenges.JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
 1315Theoretical implications
The ongoing trend of technology development will result in AI being of 
relevance to academia for a long time, as with technology, the needs and 
drivers of AI might change. In addition, as the majority of companies globally 
fit into the SME segment, a large sample size will be available when conducting 
research (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2020 ). 
Our study contributes to the existing literature by synthesizing research find-
ings within a theoretical framework and identifying emerging areas for future 
research. It emphasizes the multidimensional nature of AI adoption in SMEs 
and underscores the importance of considering environmental, technological, 
and organizational factors in facilitating successful implementation. By lever -
aging the TOE framework, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the 
enablers and barriers to AI adoption and identify research fields for fostering 
a culture of innovation and technological advancement within SMEs. In 
addition, researchers can gain an understanding of the interdependencies 
between identified clusters. Furthermore, the research ideas proposed will 
fill existing research gaps and hence facilitate more research opportunities 
for other researchers and might even enhance classroom discussions. Our 
study represents a comprehensive examination of this subject matter through 
a structured literature review, making it a valuable addition to the landscape of 
scientific research. By mapping our findings to the TOE model, a predictor for 
successfully implementing AI in SMEs, we highlight areas where existing 
literature provides substantial insights and areas where further research is 
required. This approach ensures that future research within this domain can 
be more precise.
Managerial relevance
Our systematic literature analysis reveals that AI adoption in SMEs can 
positively impact business when new technologies align with existing prac -
tices. Decision-makers should foster a learning culture, invest in the work -
force, engage in transparent communication, and practice adaptable 
leadership. To implement AI successfully, a robust legal framework is essential 
to guide decision-makers. SMEs must address challenges like limited 
resources, resistance, and compatibility. By acquiring necessary skills, effec -
tively managing, and assessing AI’s benefits, SMEs can overcome these chal-
lenges and harness AI’s power.
In the evolving business landscape, SMEs should leverage their size and 
agility. Streamlined communication, innovation readiness, and leadership 
involvement enhance adaptability to AI-driven changes, driving innovation 
and competitive advantage. Our findings highlight the crucial role of external 
factors, such as governmental policies and competitive pressures, in shaping 1316
 J. SCHWAEKE ET AL.the AI adoption landscape for SMEs. Supportive policies are needed to miti-
gate financial constraints and foster an environment conducive to AI imple -
mentation, underscoring policymakers’ role in facilitating technological 
advancement within the SME sector.
SMEs’ AI readiness depends on IT infrastructure and strategic integration 
with HR. Aligning AI with existing practices, addressing challenges, and 
considering customer needs enhance adoption success. AI can help SMEs 
optimize profits, reach broader customer bases, and improve efficiency. 
Overcoming challenges and addressing AI specialist shortages are vital for 
SME transformation. Understanding and addressing these challenges enable 
SMEs to harness AI’s potential and thrive in the digital era.
Researching the integration of AI in SMEs is highly relevant, as it can 
significantly impact a firm’s competitive position within its industry 
(Giuggioli & Pellegrini, 2023 ). Decisions made by management today regard -
ing AI adoption will have far-reaching implications for these enterprises’ 
futures. Our study builds on the existing body of knowledge by emphasizing 
the significance of AI for SMEs and elucidating the key enablers, barriers, 
organizational structures, and technological and human resources essential for 
successful AI implementation. Researching AI adoption in SMEs is crucial, as 
it can be a lever for a company’s success within its segment.
Future research and limitations
Three areas for further research are particularly compelling. First, researchers 
often analyze SMEs’ AI adoption in isolation, focusing on how different 
aspects independently affect performance outcomes. However, it is essential 
to consider potential interactions, including compensating and synergistic 
effects, among these interdependent factors. Future research should explore 
how diverse facets of AI adoption across various functional domains such as 
marketing, networking, and technology collectively influence SME perfor -
mance (Albats et al., 2023 ). This research should delve deeper into digitaliza -
tion strategies within SMEs, ensuring that AI fits well with existing practices, 
recognizing challenges, and developing KPI frameworks for assessing AI 
implementation. Second, researchers should focus on country-specific phe-
nomena in SME adoption of AI. Local factors, such as regulatory frameworks, 
cultural nuances, government incentives, and economic conditions, signifi -
cantly influence AI implementation. Investigating how these factors shape the 
strategies and outcomes of AI use by SMEs in different countries can provide 
valuable insights for tailoring AI adoption strategies and policies to the unique 
characteristics of SMEs in diverse global contexts (Boubaker et al., 2023 ). 
Third, research should examine AI adoption and impact within various SME 
contexts, such as founder- and family owned enterprises (Worek & Aaltonen,  
2023 ) and women- and minority-owned enterprises (Mendonça de Lima et al.,  JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
 13172023 ). These distinct ownership structures and demographics can introduce 
unique dynamics and challenges to AI integration. Investigating how AI 
adoption strategies, barriers, and outcomes differ among these SME categories 
can enhance understanding of tailored approaches for maximizing AI’s ben-
efits while addressing the specific constraints and opportunities associated 
with each ownership or demographic profile.
This study has two principal limitations. First, it exclusively encompasses 
published peer-reviewed papers. This narrow focus raises the possibility of pub-
lication bias, wherein studies with statistically significant results tend to receive 
preferential publication over those with nonsignificant results (Egger et al., 2001 ). 
Consequently, it is prudent to exercise caution when extrapolating our findings to 
broader contexts. Second, although we have exclusively reported on capabilities 
that have received the highest frequency of research attention, it nevertheless 
remains plausible that these capabilities may not necessarily possess the strongest 
correlation with performance outcomes. To discern which capabilities exhibit the 
most robust relationships with performance, we encourage further research endea -
vors, such as meta-analyses dedicated to each category of capability.
Conclusion
The integration of AI within SMEs is a multifaceted endeavor influenced by 
various enablers and barriers along technological, organizational, and environ -
mental dimensions. The exploration of literature regarding AI’s impact on SMEs 
underscores its potential to enhance efficiency, competitiveness, customer experi -
ence, and sustainability across domains such as finance, marketing, and human 
resource management (Hansen & Bøgh, 2021 ).
The TOE model is a robust framework for understanding the factors driving AI 
adoption in SMEs. Our findings align with this model, demonstrating the sig-
nificance of factors like technology compatibility, organizational culture, senior 
management commitment, innovation perception, and risk-taking propensity, but 
also show that some dimensions are underrepresented in the literature (Nguyen 
et al., 2022 ). These blind spots include trend identification and legal requirements 
for AI implementation, noting that academia calls for clear policies through legal 
requirements.
Overall, this research increases the understanding of the complex interplay 
between AI adoption and SMEs, offering valuable insights into how SMEs 
navigate the dynamic landscape of technological innovation. AI technologies 
present SMEs with a plethora of opportunities to optimize profits, reach 
a broader customer base, and improve efficiency and competitive advantage 
(Hansen & Bøgh, 2021 ). This research aligns existing literature with the 
operational TOE model and underscores that successful AI adoption depends 
on aligning existing practices and cultures and addressing customer needs 
while simultaneously considering potential challenges, including financing, 1318
 J. SCHWAEKE ET AL.resistance, compatibility, complexity, and legal issues. Compatibility spans 
across work methodologies, necessities, and cultural aspects, exerting an 
influence on AI integration (Chatterjee et al., 2022 ). When AI aligns with 
the specific needs and innovation objectives of SMEs, the likelihood of their 
enthusiastic adoption increases. By embracing AI-driven efficiency improve -
ments, SMEs can enhance customer experiences, foster sustainable practices, 
and position themselves at the forefront of digital transformation. AI adoption 
by SMEs faces challenges and barriers ranging from financial constraints and 
internal resistance to organizational complexity and legal considerations 
(Venkateswarlu et al., 2022 ). To foster successful AI implementation, SMEs 
must recognize and address these challenges. Furthermore, addressing the 
scarcity of AI specialists is crucial to maximizing the benefits of AI technol -
ogies in SMEs. Understanding and overcoming these challenges is essential if 
SMEs are to harness the transformative potential of AI and thrive in this 
dynamic digital era. Aspects such as a learning culture and openness toward 
AI are part of the organizational dimension, and it should be noted that 
a positive culture and therefore a welcoming attitude toward new technology 
will improve the likelihood of AI adoption within SMEs.
